Hello there,
 
* To run this program please make sure your terminal is in the directory of the Project_2_0810976. 
* Next, kindly run the command line >

 ./Project2 circuit_netlist_case2.txt output_Matrix.txt

* Or alternatively 
First run >

g++ Project2.cpp -o Project2

And then in your terminal run >

./Project2 input_circuitDiscription.txt output_example.txt



**************
* At this point you should be able to see one output file of however name was input in the second step.

- This program will output one file, this file includes the mnaMatrix, the output_RHS and the solution from LU.
- feel free to change the case of the first argument to your own convenience, the files included case1, case2 ...
- in case wanna check other files can also include to directory and change first argument accordingly.

Hope this helps, and thanks for using this program.
