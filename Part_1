# Readme

Hello there,
 
* To run this program please kindly run the command line >

 ./Project1 circuit_netlist_case2.txt output_mnaMatrix.txt output_xVector.txt output_rhs.txt   

* Make sure your terminal is in the directory of the Project_1_0810976. 



* Or alternatively first run >

g++ Project1.cpp -o Project1

* And then run >

./Project1 circuit_netlist_case2.txt output_mnaMatrix.txt output_xVector.txt output_rhs.txt 




**************
* At this point you should be able to see three output files

* This program will output the three files, first one is output_mnaMatrix.txt, second one is output_xVector.txt and third one is output_rhs.txt.
* feel free to change the case of the first argument to your own convenience, the files included case1, case2, and case3.
* in case wanna check other files can also include to directory and change first argument accordingly.

Hope this helps, and thanks for using this program.
